      All of the data on the Health Atlas is available for download. Downloads are in the form of CSVs, excel files, or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation). JSON is a lightweight, JavaScript-based data format that is easy to read and write. JSON is a convenient format for data sharing because it's easy for computers to parse and generate - especially in Ruby, the programming language that Chicago Health Atlas is built on.
